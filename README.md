# Comparative-Performance-study-of-different-programming-languages-for-huge-matrices

This project aims to compare the performance of different programming languages in handling operations on huge matrices. The languages included in this study are Python, C, C++, R, and MATLAB. The goal is to identify which language offers the best performance in terms of speed and efficiency for matrix computations.

### Performance Metrics: Execution time, memory usage, and computational efficiency.
### Matrix Operations: Addition, multiplication.
### Languages Covered: Python, C, C++, R, and MATLAB.

#### Prerequisites

Python 3.x

GCC (for C and C++)

R and RStudio

MATLAB

Necessary libraries for each language
